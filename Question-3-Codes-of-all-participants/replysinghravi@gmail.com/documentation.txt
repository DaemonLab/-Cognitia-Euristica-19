The typical information extraction architecture works as follows:

1.Segment the body—split the text into an array of sentences
2.Tokenize—split each sentence into an array of words
3.Part of Speech Tagging (POS)-tag each word with a grammatical label
4.Chunking—group and label multi-token sequences

After 4. the program will only return those chunks having label as "PERSON" in them.

For extraction of phone no. and email regex is used which extract any phone no. and email from the text file.

The idea and code has been inspired from this medium article-
